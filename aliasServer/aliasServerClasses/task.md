### Type aliases

A [type alias](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-aliases.html) allows you to define an alternative name for an existing type.
The most common use of type aliases is shortening long type names.
In this case, you can use a different shorter name:

```kotlin
typealias Words = List<String>

// Next you can use <Words> in any cases when you need to have <List<String>>:
fun foo(): Words = TODO() // must return List<String>
```


### Classes

#### General definition

During software development process, it is often impractical to implement the whole application
using only functions as building blocks.
If you are designing a large complex system and using the principles of object-oriented programming,
you can divide the application into several entities, with each
entity responsible for its own functionality.

Consider a board game as an example.
Let's say we have a `GameCard` entity and a function to generate a list of words inside it.
Of course, we can implement a function that will return some list of words separately,
without a link to the `GameCard` entity.
However, the `GameCard` entity may have some _properties_, for example, its capacity.
In this case, you will need to pass all the properties of the `GameCard` entity to the function manually
and keep track of them later.
It is inconvenient and error-prone.

#### Kotlin definition

**Classes** can act as such special entities, similar to `GameCard`.
In Kotlin, you need to use the [`class`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html) keyword to define a new class:

```kotlin
class GameCard
```

#### Properties

Next, you can set up all _properties_ in the [_primary constructor_](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors),
which should store each _instance_ in this class:

```kotlin
class GameCard(val capacity: Int = 5)
```
In the example above, we specified that every card in the game has a capacity,
and the default capacity is five.

```kotlin
class GameCard(val capacity: Int = 5)

// Next we can create a new instance
fun main() {
    val card1 = GameCard() // a new card with capacity 5

    val card2 = GameCard(4) // a new card with capacity 4
}
```

In simple terms, you create a new type that you can then use in your program:

```kotlin
class GameCard(val capacity: Int = 5)

fun foo(card: GameCard): Unit = TODO("Not implemented yet")
```

<div class="hint" title="An example with several properties in the class">

In classes, you can add several properties:
  ```kotlin
  class GameCard(
    val capacity: Int = 5,
    val contentType: String,
  )
  
  // Next we can create a new instance
  fun main() {
    val card1 = GameCard(contentType = "word") // a new card with capacity 5 and contentType "word"
  
    val card2 = GameCard(4, "word") // a new card with capacity 4 and contentType "word"
  }
  ```
</div>


#### Methods

In addition, each class can have a set of _methods_.
Simply put, these are functions that can be called on any _instance_ of this class.
Inside such functions, both the method's arguments and all _properties_ of the class are available:

```kotlin
class GameCard(val capacity: Int = 5) {
    fun generateNewWords(language: String = "en") : List<String> {
        // You can use <language> and <capacity> here
        TODO("Not implemented yet")
    }
}
```



Next, you can call the method, specifying the method's name after the name of the entity followed by a dot:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val card = GameCard() // a new card with capacity 5
    val words = card.generateNewWords()
}
```

#### Access modifiers

Classes can have properties and methods, but some of those can be internal.
To restrict their usage, we can apply special _access modifiers_.
By default, all properties and methods have the `public` access modifier, which means that they can be used from anywhere.
However, if you specify the `private` modifier, then they can only be used inside the class.
There are also other modifiers, and we will look at them later.

<div class="hint" title="Example of access modifiers">

By default, all modifiers are `public`:

```kotlin
class GameCard(val capacity: Int = 5) {
    fun generateNewWords(language: String = "en") : List<String> {
        TODO("Not implemented yet")
    }
  
    fun anotherFunction() {
        val a = capacity // OK
        val b = generateNewWords() // OK
    }
}

fun main() {
    val card = GameCard() // a new card with capacity 5
    card.capacity // OK
    card.generateNewWords() // OK
}
```

However, we can change them to `private`:

```kotlin
class GameCard(private val capacity: Int = 5) {
    private fun generateNewWords(language: String = "en") : List<String> {
        TODO("Not implemented yet")
    }

    fun anotherFunction() {
        val a = capacity // OK
        val b = generateNewWords() // OK
    }
}

fun main() {
    val card = GameCard() // a new card with capacity 5
    card.capacity // ERROR
    card.generateNewWords() // ERROR
}
```

</div>

If you are designing a large or complex application,
remember to use various access modifiers, including `private`.

<div class="hint" title="Examples of usage different access modifiers">

The `private` modifier is commonly used for internal functionality in the class, e.g.,
if you create a helper function to avoid code duplication in the original one:

  ```kotlin
  class GameCard(val capacity: Int = 5) {
    fun generateNewWords(language: String = "en") : List<String> {
      val words: List<String> = TODO("Not implemented yet")
      return words.filter { isValidWord(it) }
    }
  
    private fun isValidWord(str: String): Boolean  = str.all { it.isLetter() }
  }
  ```

In the example above, we created a private function `isValidWord` to keep only valid words for the card.
However, it is _internal_ functionality for this class and reflects the internal logic of word generation.
In such a case, we should mark it as a `private` function.
