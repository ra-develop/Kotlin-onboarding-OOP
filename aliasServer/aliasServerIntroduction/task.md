Hello! Welcome to the second module of the Kotlin onboarding course.
This module will introduce you to the concepts of **object-oriented programming** (OOP)
in the context of the Kotlin language.
We assume that you have completed the first part of the course
or are familiar with the Kotlin constructions it covers.

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html),
which you can read later.

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project:
step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a fully working project in the end.
At the end of each lesson, an additional project will be offered:
it includes all the topics of the lesson but does not contain any theory materials.
The topic of this module is board games.
It means that in each lesson, you will create one of the popular games as a web application.
Note, part of the code will be prewritten by the course author
to avoid going deep into web programming in this course.

### Project description

The project of this lesson is **Alias**.
Probably everyone knows this party board game.
In this game, you need to divide into teams and explain as many words from the
card as possible in a limited time.

### Lesson topics
